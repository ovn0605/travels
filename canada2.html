	   <p class="textpart"> This was our second visit to Canada. The main purpose of the visit was that Dhaneshen was going to join the Macewan University. we again landed in Calgary and stayed with my brother-in-law for a few days, during which we bought the required amenities and Utensils for Dhaneshen. The we took a coach for a 3.5-hours ride to Edmonton. The drive was a relatively long one as compared to what we are used to. There is no stopping for reshment on the way. From the bus terminius we took a uber to the South-West, where we would stay during the visit. During the stay in Edmonton, we travelled a lot by bus and the LRT, getting to know the City. Travelling by public transport in Edmonton can be quite challenging and time-consuming. The firstthing we noticed is that the LRT covers only a very small part of Edmonton and consists of only two lines, which run though one common line for the majority of the trip. The next thing is that you don't easily get a direct bus between any two regions. Travelling between two places taht take 15 to 20 minutes by car can take more than one hour by public transport as it may require 2-3 bus trips or a bus, followed bt LRT, followed by another bus. </p>
	  	
	   <p class="textpart1"> We paid a visit to MacEwan University to complete the admission and registration procedures for Dhaneshen. We were quite impressed with the size of the University. It spans over several blocks of buildings on 104 avenue, crossing several streets, but one can walk internally from one end of the University to the other without having to get down to the streets. Even crossing the streets is done through indoor platforms. One end is close to the MacEwan LRT station. It has a big indoor gymnasium and football pit, a big library and several labs. Each of the buildings has several floors. The residence is also very big, having eleven floors. It is located near the other end of the building close, from the LRT station. It's close enough to the University so that students don't have to walk a lot in open air as this can be pretty uncomfortable in Winter.</p>
	  
	   <p class="textpart"> While being in Edmonton, we seized the opportunity to visit some of the main attractions of Edmonton. One of the most important one is definitely the West Edmonton mall. With its very large number and variety of shops, its large food court and the its nice architecture, it's definitely very impressive. The food court contains a really large sitting space surronded by world-wide types of food outlets. There is food for all tastes. More impressive even is its ice palace where a lot of people practice skating on ice. There is also the water park with its artificial sea and there is a kind of small river that runs through a part of the mall, where there are dolphin shows several times per day.</p>
	 
	   <p class="textpart1"> We also visited Fort McMurray. We did the Edmonton-Fort McMurray trip by coach. The trip lasted for more than 5 hours, bur the coach wa pretty comfortable. Travelling through miles of forest and fields of hay and flowers was really enjoyable. There is a stop of about 15 minutes in grassland which is about half-way between Edmonton and Fort McMurray. There is a gas station, with an accompanying shop that sells a number of stuffs suitable for travellers, specially freshly prepared hot meal. We use the 15 minutes stop to stretch our legs while at the same time having some hot meal and cold drinks. The driver does a head count before restarting the vehicle and the remainder of the road took almost another 2.5 hours. For at least  a 100 km before reaching Fort McMurray, we witnessed the desolating sight resulting from the fire than had occurred a few months before and had devastated the forests. We reached Fort Mc Murray at about 5.30 pm, but as it was August, it was still broad daylight at that time. The burnt trees clearly indicated the extent of the damage.</p>
	   <p class="textpart"> My brother-in-law came to pick us up from the bus terminus. Although the trip by coach had been quite comfortable, we were still happy to get out of the coach as being for 5 hours in a coach, inspite of a 15 minutes break is quite tiring. Fort McMurray is not a very big town. However, it has all the ammenities of the big cities. Life there, looks very peaceful, definitely much less hectic than Edmonton and Calgary. The traffic is relatively light and the roads are not crowded. There is no light rail and we didn't see to many buses either. As it is located very much to the North of Alberta, the temperature is colder than Edmonton. </p>
